# OAuth Consent Screen Setup Guide

**Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions for configuring Google OAuth consent screen for SEO Ads Expert
**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-08

---

## üéØ Overview

The OAuth consent screen is what users see when they authorize SEO Ads Expert to access their Google Ads account. Google requires this to be properly configured and verified before granting API production access.

**Critical Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ App must be verified (moves from "Testing" to "Published" status)
- ‚úÖ Privacy Policy URL must be live and publicly accessible
- ‚úÖ Terms of Service URL must be live and publicly accessible
- ‚úÖ Support email must be functional
- ‚úÖ App domain must match your website

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (the one with Google Ads API enabled)
3. Navigate to: **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen** (left sidebar)
4. If you haven't created a consent screen yet, you'll see a setup wizard

---

### Step 2: Choose User Type

**Question**: "Who will use this app?"

**Answer**: **External**
- Select "External" (allows any Google account holder to authorize)
- Click "Create"

**Why External?**:
- "Internal" is only for Google Workspace organizations
- SEO Ads Expert will be used by external Google Ads customers
- This is the standard choice for public applications

---

### Step 3: App Information

**Fill out the following fields**:

#### **App name***
```
SEO Ads Expert
```
**Why**: This is the name users see when authorizing your app

---

#### **User support email***
```
support@littlebearapps.com
```
**Why**: Users contact this email for help with authorization
**Verify**: Make sure this email is set up and monitored

---

#### **App logo** (Optional but recommended)
- Upload a 120x120px logo for SEO Ads Expert
- PNG or JPG format
- Shows on consent screen (builds trust)

**If you don't have a logo yet**: Skip for now, can add later

---

#### **Application home page** (Optional but recommended)
```
https://littlebearapps.com
```
**Why**: Links to your main website
**Verify**: Make sure littlebearapps.com is live and professional

---

#### **Application privacy policy link***
```
https://littlebearapps.com/privacy
```
**Why**: Required by Google to show how you handle user data
**CRITICAL**: This page MUST be live before submitting for verification

**Verify**:
- [ ] URL is publicly accessible (no login required)
- [ ] Page includes all 9 sections from privacy-policy-requirements.md
- [ ] Page mentions Google Ads API data handling
- [ ] Contact emails are listed (privacy@, security@, support@)

---

#### **Application terms of service link***
```
https://littlebearapps.com/terms
```
**Why**: Required by Google to define user agreements
**CRITICAL**: This page MUST be live before submitting for verification

**Verify**:
- [ ] URL is publicly accessible (no login required)
- [ ] Page includes all sections from terms-of-service-draft.md
- [ ] Page mentions Google Ads API compliance
- [ ] User responsibilities clearly stated

---

#### **Authorized domains***
```
littlebearapps.com
```
**Why**: Restricts redirect URIs and links to this domain only
**Format**: No "https://" or "www." prefix - just the domain

**If you need multiple domains** (e.g., staging):
```
littlebearapps.com
staging.littlebearapps.com
```

---

#### **Developer contact information***
```
nathan@littlebearapps.com
```
**Why**: Google contacts this email during the review process
**CRITICAL**: Monitor this email closely during application review

---

**Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"**

---

### Step 4: Scopes

**What are scopes?**: Permissions your app requests from users

**Required Scope for SEO Ads Expert**:

1. Click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"
2. In the search box, enter: `adwords`
3. Check the box for:
   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords
   ```
   **Description**: "View and manage your Google Ads accounts"

4. Scroll down and click "UPDATE"

**Verify**:
- [ ] Only `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords` is selected
- [ ] No other unnecessary scopes are added

**Why only one scope?**:
- Google prefers minimal necessary permissions
- More scopes = longer review process
- Easier to justify in application

**Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"**

---

### Step 5: Test Users (Testing Mode Only)

**What this section is for**: While your app is in "Testing" status, only these email addresses can authorize it.

**During Development**:
1. Click "ADD USERS"
2. Add your own Google account email(s):
   ```
   nathan@littlebearapps.com
   your-test-account@gmail.com
   ```
3. Add any team members who need to test
4. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

**After Verification** (Published status):
- This section becomes irrelevant
- Any Google account holder can authorize your app
- No need to pre-approve users

**Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"**

---

### Step 6: Summary and Verification

## üö® Common Verification Issues

### Issue 1: "Privacy Policy Does Not Meet Requirements"

**Symptoms**:
- Google rejects verification
- Email says "privacy policy insufficient"

**Solutions**:
- Verify all 9 sections from privacy-policy-requirements.md are included
- Add explicit "we do NOT share Google Ads data" statement
- Mention GDPR/CCPA compliance and user rights
- Include contact emails for privacy requests
- Link privacy policy from app footer and consent screen

---

### Issue 2: "App Domain Mismatch"

**Symptoms**:
- Verification rejected
- Email mentions domain verification failure

**Solutions**:
- Ensure authorized domain matches exactly: `littlebearapps.com`
- Don't include "https://" or "www."
- Verify domain ownership in Google Search Console if needed
- Make sure privacy/terms URLs use the same domain

---

### Issue 3: "Scope Justification Required"

**Symptoms**:
- Google asks why you need `adwords` scope

**Solutions**:
- Provide detailed explanation in follow-up email:
  ```
  SEO Ads Expert uses the Google Ads API to:
  1. Read campaign performance data (impressions, clicks, costs, conversions)
  2. Apply user-approved optimizations (budget adjustments, bid changes, keyword additions)
  3. Maintain audit logs of all changes for rollback capability

  The "adwords" scope is the only scope that provides access to the Google Ads API.
  Users explicitly approve all changes before they are applied to their accounts.
  ```

---

### Issue 4: "Test Account Required"

**Symptoms**:
- Google requests a demo/test account

**Solutions**:
- Provide test credentials in follow-up email
- Ensure test account shows OAuth flow clearly
- Have sample Google Ads data ready to demonstrate
- Explain CLI workflow in email if no web UI yet
