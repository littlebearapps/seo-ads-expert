## 📋 Application Form Questions & Answers

### Q1: How do you use the Google Ads API?

**COPY THIS:**
```
We use the Google Ads API for both read and write operations:

READ OPERATIONS (Performance Data):
- Campaign, ad group, keyword, and ad performance metrics
- Search terms reports and Quality Score data
- Budget utilization and pacing information
- Conversion tracking and attribution data

WRITE OPERATIONS (User-Approved Optimizations):
- Budget adjustments based on ML recommendations
- Bid strategy updates and keyword bid modifications
- Keyword additions/removals after user review
- Ad creative updates (pause/enable, RSA experiments)

APPROVAL WORKFLOW:
All write operations occur only after:
1. User reviews a detailed diff preview (before → after values)
2. User explicitly approves the change via confirmation dialog
3. OR user has enabled auto-apply for specific features with daily operation caps

AUDITABILITY:
Every API operation is logged with:
- Who: User ID or system (if auto-applied)
- What: Entity type, ID, and change details
- When: Timestamp (UTC)
- Before/After: Old value → New value
- Status: Success, Failed, or Rolled Back

Users can rollback recent changes via the audit log interface.
```

### Q2: Do you automate changes to Google Ads accounts?

**COPY THIS:**
```
By default, NO changes occur without explicit user approval. Our core workflow is:

STANDARD WORKFLOW (Default):
1. ML analysis generates optimization recommendations
2. User reviews detailed diff preview
3. User approves or rejects via confirmation dialog
4. Changes applied only after approval

OPTIONAL AUTO-APPLY FEATURE:
Users MAY enable per-feature automation (e.g., budget optimization) with these safeguards:
- Explicit opt-in per feature (default: OFF for all features)
- Daily operation caps (e.g., max 50 changes/day)
- Entity scoping (apply only to selected campaigns/ad groups)
- Email summaries of all auto-applied changes
- Kill switch to disable all automation immediately
- One-click rollback for recent changes

USER CONTROL:
- Users can disable auto-apply at any time
- All auto-applied changes are logged with full audit trail
- Changes are reversible where feasible (budgets, bids)
- Users maintain complete visibility and control

PHILOSOPHY:
We provide ML-driven insights with human oversight, not "set-and-forget" automation.
The tool complements the Google Ads UI by streamlining the review-and-approve workflow,
while maintaining the same user control model.
```

### Q3: How do you use AI/ML in your product?

**COPY THIS:**
```
We use Thompson Sampling (a Bayesian bandit algorithm) to:

WHAT THOMPSON SAMPLING DOES:
- Prioritizes which optimization opportunities to surface first
- Balances exploration (testing new strategies) vs exploitation (scaling winners)
- Estimates expected impact of proposed changes with confidence intervals
- Adapts recommendations based on observed performance data

ML OUTPUT PRESENTATION:
- Recommendations shown as drafts with confidence intervals (e.g., "75-85% confidence")
- Explanations provided for each suggestion (e.g., "Low traffic variant needs exploration")
- Expected impact estimates (e.g., "+12% CVR lift projected")
- Clear labeling as "ML-Suggested" or "Experimental"
- Users can see the reasoning behind each recommendation

USER CONTROL & TRANSPARENCY:
- Users review ALL ML outputs before applying
- Users can edit, modify, or dismiss any recommendation
- Users can approve individual suggestions or batch operations
- ML does NOT autonomously make changes
- All ML-suggested changes follow the same approval workflow as manual changes

PHILOSOPHY:
AI is assistive, not autonomous. Thompson Sampling helps users prioritize their work
and understand expected outcomes, but final decisions remain with the user. This is
similar to Google Ads' own Recommendations tab, where ML suggests and users decide.
```

### Q4: What data do you collect and how is it stored?

**COPY THIS:**
```
DATA COLLECTED:
- OAuth tokens (refresh tokens for Google Ads API access)
- Google Ads performance data (campaigns, keywords, ads, metrics)
- User preferences (auto-apply settings, notification emails)
- Audit logs (change history: who/what/when/before/after)

STORAGE & SECURITY:
- OAuth tokens: Encrypted at rest using AES-256, stored in secure credential vault
- Performance data: SQLite database, 7-day cache, then automatically deleted
- Audit logs: 90-day retention, then archived or purged
- User preferences: Stored until user deletes account
- Access controls: Role-based permissions, session timeouts (30 minutes)
- Encryption: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest for sensitive data

DATA RETENTION POLICY:
- Performance cache: 7 days (automatic purge)
- Audit logs: 90 days (then archived/deleted)
- User account data: Until user requests deletion (honored within 30 days)

THIRD-PARTY SHARING:
- We do NOT share Google Ads data with third parties
- No data resale or aggregation for external services
- Data used only to provide optimization features to the account owner
- No cross-account data mixing or comparison

COMPLIANCE:

### Q5: How many Google Ads accounts will you access?

**COPY THIS:**
```
CURRENT ACCESS (Today):
- 1 production account: Customer ID 9495806872 (our own campaigns)
- Purpose: Internal campaign management and algorithm development

TESTING PHASE (Next 3-6 months):
- 1 production account (our campaigns)
- 5-10 test accounts (algorithm validation, no real spend)
- Purpose: Validate Thompson Sampling across different account structures
- Estimated daily operations: 1,000-2,000 ops/day

FUTURE PRODUCTION (12+ months):
- 50-100 client accounts (if we launch as SaaS product)
- Estimated daily operations: 5,000-10,000 ops/day total
- Well within Basic Access limits (15,000 ops/day)

USER AUTHENTICATION:
- Each account requires explicit OAuth consent from account owner
- Users link their accounts individually via standard Google OAuth flow
- Users can revoke access anytime through Google Account settings
- We never request MCC-level access without explicit user permission

USAGE PATTERN:
- Conservative API usage (exponential backoff, rate limiting)
- Chunked batch operations to respect quotas
- Monitoring and alerting for quota usage
- No bulk operations without user approval
```

### Q7: Why do you need production API access? (Why not use Google Ads Scripts?)

**COPY THIS:**
```
LIMITATIONS OF GOOGLE ADS SCRIPTS:
- 30-minute execution limit (insufficient for ML training)
- No cross-account Thompson Sampling (requires unified data access)
- Limited UI capabilities (difficult to show diff previews, approvals)
- Cannot integrate with external BI tools and data sources
- Restricted access to certain API endpoints
- No OAuth-based user authentication

WHY WE NEED FULL API ACCESS:

1. THOMPSON SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS:
   - Need to analyze performance data across accounts for Bayesian modeling
   - Require longer execution times for statistical computations
   - Must persist model state between executions

2. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP WORKFLOW:
   - Need rich UI for diff previews and approval workflows
   - Require OAuth authentication per user account
   - Must integrate with external web interface (planned)

3. INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES:
   - Integrate with our business intelligence stack
   - Combine Google Ads data with Search Console, Analytics, RapidAPI
   - Export to custom reporting formats (CSV, JSON, Markdown)

4. SCALE & RELIABILITY:
   - Support multiple users with individual OAuth tokens
   - Operate beyond 30-minute execution windows
   - Provide real-time responsiveness for user actions

5. COMPLIANCE & AUDIT:
   - Comprehensive audit logging with before/after values
   - User-specific permissions and access controls
   - GDPR/CCPA data deletion capabilities

Scripts are excellent for simple automation, but our ML-driven, multi-user
platform requires the full capabilities and flexibility of the Google Ads API.
```

### Q8: How do you ensure compliance with Google Ads policies?

**COPY THIS:**
```
POLICY COMPLIANCE MEASURES:

1. USER CONSENT:
   - Every account requires explicit OAuth consent
   - Users see exactly what permissions we request (only adwords scope)
   - Users can revoke access anytime via Google Account settings

2. TRANSPARENCY:
   - All changes shown in diff preview before application
   - Audit logs track every operation with full details
   - Users receive email summaries of auto-applied changes

## 📞 If Asked For Clarification

### Common Follow-Up Questions:

**Q: "Can you provide a demo?"**
**A:** "Yes! We've prepared a 5-minute screencast demonstrating the full workflow: [INSERT SCREENCAST URL]. We're also happy to schedule a live demo at your convenience. Demo credentials: [INSERT DEMO LOGIN INFO]"

**Q: "How do you prevent abuse?"**
**A:** "Multiple safeguards: OAuth per account, preview-and-approve required (default), auto-apply requires opt-in with caps, audit logs track all operations, rate limiting, kill switch for immediate shutdown, data encryption, GDPR/CCPA compliance."

**Q: "What if users don't want ML recommendations?"**
**A:** "Users can dismiss any recommendation. Auto-apply is completely optional (OFF by default). The tool also works as a manual campaign management interface without any ML features enabled."

**Q: "How is this different from automated bidding?"**
**A:** "Automated bidding runs continuously without user review. Our tool presents recommendations that users review and approve. Even with auto-apply enabled, users set strict caps and can disable anytime. It's closer to Google Ads' Recommendations tab (suggestions) than to automated bid strategies (autonomous)."
