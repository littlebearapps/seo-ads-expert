## üé• Recording Tips

### Technical Setup
- **Tool**: Loom (easiest) or OBS Studio (more control)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- **Frame rate**: 30fps minimum
- **Audio**: Built-in mic OK if clear, external mic better
- **Webcam**: Optional (face can build trust)

### Narration Best Practices
- **Pace**: Slow and clear (reviewers may not be native English speakers)
- **Tone**: Professional but friendly
- **Volume**: Consistent, not too quiet or too loud
- **Pauses**: Brief pause after each key point
- **Script**: Practice 2-3 times before recording
- **Errors**: OK to edit/splice if needed

### Visual Best Practices
- **Mouse movements**: Slow and deliberate
- **Highlights**: Circle or arrow cursor for emphasis
- **Zoom**: Use browser zoom if text too small
- **Transitions**: Smooth, not jarring
- **Test data**: Use realistic but obviously test data
- **Sensitive info**: Hide real customer IDs, emails, revenue

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Rushing through features (speak slowly!)
- ‚ùå Skipping the approval step (critical to show!)
- ‚ùå Not showing the kill switch (Google wants to see it)
- ‚ùå Using real production data (privacy risk)
- ‚ùå Audio levels too low or inconsistent
- ‚ùå Screen too cluttered with tabs/notifications
- ‚ùå Going over 5:00 (strict time limit)
