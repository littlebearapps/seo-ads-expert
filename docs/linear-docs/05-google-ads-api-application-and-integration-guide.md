## üîê Authentication & Integration Status

### Current Integration

**APIs Integrated** ‚úÖ:
- **Google Search Console**: Connected via unified OAuth (sc-domain:littlebearapps.com)
- **Google Analytics**: Connected with GA4 property 497547311
- **Google Ads**: Connected with customer ID 9495806872 and developer token
- **RapidAPI Real-Time Web Search**: SERP analysis (20,000 calls/month)

**Authentication Strategy**:
- **Application Default Credentials (ADC)**: Short-lived tokens via `gcloud auth application-default login`
- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: For Google Ads, Analytics, Search Console APIs
- **Unified OAuth Flow**: Single authorization for all 3 Google APIs
- **No Service Account JSON**: Security risk (long-lived keys), ADC provides auto-rotation

---

### API Access Levels

- Apply after 90 days of Basic Access usage

---

### Rate Limiting & Quota Management

**Google Ads API Quotas**:
- 15,000 operations/day (Basic Access limit)

- Alert triggers on threshold breaches (80%, 95%, 100%)
- Auto-pause on limit exceeded

**Performance**:
- Plan generation: 11 seconds end-to-end
- API efficiency: 3-10 SERP calls per run
- Smart precedence: KWP CSV > GSC > RapidAPI

## üîç Common Review Issues

### Issue 1: Privacy Policy Insufficient

**Symptoms**:
- Google rejects verification
- Email says "privacy policy does not meet requirements"

**Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Verify all 9 sections included (see privacy-policy-requirements.md)
- ‚úÖ Add explicit "we do NOT share Google Ads data" statement
- ‚úÖ Mention GDPR/CCPA compliance and user rights
- ‚úÖ Include contact emails for privacy requests (privacy@littlebearapps.com)
- ‚úÖ Link privacy policy from app footer and consent screen

---

### Issue 2: App Domain Mismatch

**Symptoms**:
- Verification rejected
- Email mentions domain verification failure

**Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Ensure authorized domain matches exactly: `littlebearapps.com`
- ‚úÖ Don't include "https://" or "www."
- ‚úÖ Verify domain ownership in Google Search Console if needed
- ‚úÖ Make sure privacy/terms URLs use the same domain

---

### Issue 3: Scope Justification Required

**Symptoms**:
- Google asks why you need `adwords` scope

**Solutions**:
- Provide detailed explanation:
  ```
  SEO Ads Expert uses the Google Ads API to:
  1. Read campaign performance data (impressions, clicks, costs, conversions)
  2. Apply user-approved optimizations (budget adjustments, bid changes, keyword additions)
  3. Maintain audit logs of all changes for rollback capability

  The "adwords" scope is the only scope that provides access to the Google Ads API.
  Users explicitly approve all changes before they are applied to their accounts.
  ```

---

### Issue 4: Demo Account Required

**Symptoms**:
- Google requests a test account for review

**Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Provide test credentials in follow-up email
- ‚úÖ Ensure test account shows OAuth flow clearly
- ‚úÖ Have sample Google Ads data ready to demonstrate
- ‚úÖ Explain CLI workflow (no web UI yet, but compliance features visible)
