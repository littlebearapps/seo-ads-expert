# Google Cloud Service Account Setup for Search Console API

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Choose Credential Type
When prompted "Which API are you using?":
- **Select: "Application data"**
- This creates a service account (not OAuth client)

### 2. Create Service Account
On the "Create a service account" screen:

**Service account details:**
- **Service account name**: `seo-ads-expert`
- **Service account ID**: `seo-ads-expert` (auto-fills)
- **Description**: "Service account for SEO Ads Expert tool to access Search Console data"
- Click **"Create and Continue"**

### 3. Grant Service Account Access (Optional)
On the "Grant this service account access to project" screen:
- **Skip this step** - Click **"Continue"**
- (We don't need project-level roles, just Search Console access)

### 4. Grant Users Access (Optional)
On the "Grant users access to this service account" screen:
- **Skip this step** - Click **"Done"**

### 5. Service Account Created!
You'll now see your service account listed. The email will be:
```
seo-ads-expert@YOUR-PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### 6. Create Key (Optional - Skip if using ADC)

**IMPORTANT**: Since you already have Application Default Credentials (ADC) set up, you can SKIP creating a JSON key! ADC is more secure.

If you need a key for production/CI:
1. Click on the service account email
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" â†’ "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON" format
5. Save the downloaded file securely

### 7. Add Service Account to Search Console

**This is the critical step!**

1. Copy the service account email: `seo-ads-expert@YOUR-PROJECT-ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
2. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
3. Select your property (e.g., `https://littlebearapps.com`)
4. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
5. Click **Users and permissions**
6. Click **Add user** button
7. Enter the service account email
8. Set permission level to **"Restricted"** (read-only is sufficient)
9. Click **Add**

### 8. Test the Connection

Since you're using ADC (already set up with `gcloud auth`), just run:

```bash
# Make sure Google credentials are commented out in .env
# Then test:
npx tsx src/cli.ts test
```

You should see:
```
ðŸ“Š Google Search Console: âœ… Connected
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
- Verify the service account is added to Search Console
- Check the property URL matches exactly in your .env file
- Wait 5-10 minutes for permissions to propagate

### "API not enabled" error
- Make sure Search Console API is enabled in your project
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/searchconsole.googleapis.com

### ADC not working
- Run: `gcloud auth application-default login` again
- Check: `ls ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
- Ensure all Google credential lines are commented out in .env

## Security Notes

With your current ADC setup:
- âœ… No JSON keys to download or manage
- âœ… Credentials automatically refresh
- âœ… Most secure option for local development
- âœ… Service account only has access to Search Console (minimal permissions)

## Summary

1. Choose "Application data" âœ…
2. Create service account named `seo-ads-expert` âœ…
3. Skip role grants âœ…
4. Skip key creation (using ADC) âœ…
5. Add service account to Search Console âœ…
6. Test the connection âœ…

The key part is adding the service account email to your Search Console property - that's what grants access!
