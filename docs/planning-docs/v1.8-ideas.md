Absolutely—here’s a tight, build-ready map for v1.8: Entity Coverage, Schema Depth & Content Roadmap. No heavy code; just clear contracts, thresholds, and tasks so you can ship quickly.

⸻

# 0) Scope & outcomes

Objective: raise organic ceiling by (a) auditing topical/intent coverage vs SERP leaders, (b) emitting validated JSON-LD schema, and (c) producing a prioritized content roadmap + internal linking plan.

You’ll ship:
	•	An entity/intent auditor per cluster.
	•	Schema emit + validator (SoftwareApplication, FAQPage, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, Article).
	•	A content calendar with impact/effort scoring and required internal links.

⸻

# 1) Inputs you already have (reuse)
	•	keywords.csv (volume/intent/cluster/source).
	•	competitors.md + cached fact_serp_snapshot top10 with features.
	•	Existing site map / known URLs (from v1.3/1.9 crawler or repo glob).
	•	seo_pages.md (page briefs + target keywords).
	•	url_health.json (for schema gating).
	•	(Optional) review topics from your store-mining work.

## New lightweight inputs
	•	Page text snapshots (rendered HTML → text) for your pages only to score coverage; store hash not full text.

# 2) Key deliverables (artifacts)

Artifact contracts (compact)

coverage_gaps.md (per cluster section)
	•	Target cluster (e.g., “webp → png chrome extension”)
	•	Current coverage score (0–100), competitors average/top.
	•	Missing entities (canonical + variants).
	•	Missing sections: comparison, proof, FAQ, how-to.
	•	Recommended actions:
	•	Update existing LP (exact sections to add)
	•	New article/pillar (title, outline, target internal links)
	•	Schema to add (FAQPage/HowTo)

# 5) Auditor logic (plain English, with weights)

## 5.1 Build a canonical entity set per cluster
	•	Sources (union, dedup):
	•	Top-10 SERP H1/H2 tokens (noun chunks), PAA questions.
	•	Your keywords.csv (long-tails → entities).
	•	Review topics (“offline”, “no uploads”, “privacy”).
	•	Normalize: lowercase, singularize, strip stop-words, map synonyms (heuristic list per product).
	•	Importance score for entity e:
		
importance(e) = 0.5 * freq_in_serp(e) + 0.3 * weighted_query_volume(e) + 0.2 * intent_boost(e)

	•	freq_in_serp(e): fraction of top-10 pages mentioning e (cap at 1.0)
	•	weighted_query_volume(e): normalized volume from keywords containing e
	•	intent_boost(e): 1.0 if strongly transactional (“chrome extension”, “install”), 0.4 if informational

## 5.2 Score your page coverage
	•	Extract from page snapshot: entity presence, sections present, FAQ presence, comparison block, proof (testimonials/ratings), how-to steps.
	•	Coverage score (0–100) for page p in cluster c:
		
coverage(p,c) = 60 * sum(importance(e) for e present) / sum(importance(e) total)
              + 20 * sections_score
              + 20 * schema_score
              
 	•	sections_score: each of {FAQ, HowTo, Comparison, Proof} present = +5 (cap 20)
	•	schema_score: FAQPage + HowTo + SoftwareApplication present & valid = up to +20

## 5.3 Gap detection → actions
	•	If coverage < competitor avg − 10 → Update existing LP.
	•	If ≥2 high-importance entities absent across site → New pillar/blog proposal.
	•	If PAA shows 3+ repeated questions absent → Add FAQ block + FAQPage schema.
	•	If many “how to” tokens present in SERP → Add HowTo section (steps with HowToStep).

## 5.4 Internal link opportunities
	•	For each missing entity on LP, find sources where it is strong (pillar/hub/blog) and propose contextual link with varied anchors (exact, partial, semantic).
	•	Limit per source page (e.g., ≤3 new links) to avoid spam.

# 6) Schema emit (templates + validation)

## 6.1 SoftwareApplication (per product hub + major use-cases)

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "ConvertMyFile – WebP to PNG Converter",
  "applicationCategory": "BrowserApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS",
  "browserRequirements": "Google Chrome 120+ / Microsoft Edge 120+",
  "offers": {"@type":"Offer","price":"0","priceCurrency":"AUD"},
  "aggregateRating": {"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.8","ratingCount":"1234"},
  "publisher": {"@type":"Organization","name":"Little Bear Apps"},
  "downloadUrl": "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/...",
  "url": "https://littlebearapps.com/convertmyfile/webp-to-png",
  "description": "Convert WebP to PNG locally in your browser. Privacy-first; no uploads."
}

## 6.2 FAQPage

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Does it work offline?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. All conversions run locally; no files are uploaded."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Is it free?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. The Chrome extension is free; no account required."}}
  ]
}

## 6.3 HowTo (only if the page has clear steps)

{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"HowTo",
  "name":"How to convert WebP to PNG in Chrome",
  "totalTime":"PT1M",
  "step":[
    {"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Install ConvertMyFile","text":"Add the extension from the Chrome Web Store."},
    {"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Open a WebP image","text":"Right-click the file and choose Convert."},
    {"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Save as PNG","text":"Click Save; no uploads required."}
  ]
}

## 6.4 BreadcrumbList

{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement":[
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Extensions","item":"https://littlebearapps.com/extensions/"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"ConvertMyFile","item":"https://littlebearapps.com/convertmyfile/"},
    {"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"WebP → PNG"}
  ]
}

## 6.5 Article (for blog/pillar)

{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Article",
  "headline":"WebP vs PNG: When to Use Each",
  "author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Little Bear Apps"},
  "datePublished":"2025-09-08",
  "mainEntityOfPage":"https://littlebearapps.com/blog/webp-vs-png"
}

## Validation rules (schema_lint.json)
	•	Required keys present, lengths sane (e.g., headline ≤ 110 chars).
	•	Claims gate: if claims_validation forbids “no uploads”, remove from description.
	•	URL health: only emit schema for 200/OK pages, not noindex.
	•	No duplicate FAQ questions; no HowTo if steps < 2.

⸻

# 7) Prioritization & scoring

Impact score (0–100) per recommended action:

impact = 50 * (cluster_intent_weight) 
       + 30 * (entity_importance_gap) 
       + 20 * (SERP_feature_boost)   // e.g., FAQ in SERP → FAQ gets boost
       
       Effort (1–5) heuristic:
	•	LP minor update = 2
	•	New blog = 3
	•	New pillar = 4
	•	Cross-language/localization = +1

Calendar ordering: highest (impact / effort) first; ensure a mix across products/markets.

⸻

# 8) Guardrails & integration
	•	No schema on noindex or thin pages (<250 words) → warn in schema_lint.json.
	•	Claims validator filters descriptions/answers.
	•	Internal links max per page; vary anchors (exact, partial, semantic).
	•	Market localization: emit localized title/meta/FAQ copy variants for GB/US/AU spelling differences when relevant (e.g., colour/color).

⸻

# 9) Testing
	•	Golden coverage: small fixture with 2 clusters and dummy pages; assert coverage math and gap actions.
	•	Schema snapshots: byte-level tests for schema_snippets.jsonl.
	•	Linter tests: intentionally malformed snippets should yield fail with precise messages.
	•	Link opportunities: ensure no self-links, and only to live (200) targets.

⸻

# 10) Runtime & performance
	•	Warm-run target: ≤60s per product; Cold-run ≤120s.
	•	Cache SERP snapshots; avoid re-parsing unchanged pages (hash HTML to skip).

⸻

# 11) Acceptance gates (Done means…)
	•	coverage_gaps.md lists per-cluster scores, ≥5 concrete gaps, and explicit page/section actions.
	•	schema_snippets.jsonl validates cleanly; schema_lint.json has 0 fails.
	•	content_calendar.csv is sorted by impact/effort; includes owner & due_by placeholders.
	•	internal_link_opportunities.csv proposes ≥2 links per use-case page, with varied anchors and no broken targets.

⸻

# Optional “nice add” (still v1.8 if time allows)
	•	Entity glossary page per product (auto-generated) linking to all use-cases (great crawlability).
	•	FAQ bank → LP sync: write a small helper that inserts FAQ blocks into MD/MDX from faq_bank.json with ids for dedup.
