This is a strong v1.1. You’re aiming at the right problems (import friction + bad-LP guardrails). Here’s a focused review with upgrades that will save you time and prevent gotchas.

TL;DR (what to change)
	•	Base your Ads Editor CSVs on a template exported from Editor (not docs or guesses). Build your writers to mirror that schema byte-for-byte, including pinning fields and asset associations.
	•	Tighten URL health: add robots.txt checks, redirect chains, canonical loops, and “soft-404” heuristics.
	•	Ship shared assets too (Callouts, Structured Snippets, Sitelinks via Assets + Associations), not just per-ad-group sitelinks.
	•	Guard your claims at the use-case level (format-specific) not only product level.
	•	Determinism: freeze CSV column order and line endings per file type; add snapshot tests on the CSV bytes, not just parsed JSON.

# High-ROI upgrades per task

## Task 4 — Ads Editor CSV export (biggest risk / biggest payoff)

Reality check: the Ads Editor bulk schema has many columns and subtle rules (e.g., RSA pinning). The safest path:
	1.	In a scratch Ads account, hand-create one minimal campaign with:
	•	1 campaign, 2 ad groups, a few exact/phrase keywords, one RSA with pinning, sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets, one shared negative list attached.
	2.	Export from Ads Editor (Account → Export → “Export selected campaigns and ad groups”). This gives you ground-truth CSV headers for every entity you need.
	3.	Build your writers to reproduce that exact export, including:
	•	Column names and order
	•	Entity tabs/files (Editor sometimes emits a single multi-sheet CSV vs multiple CSVs; match what your Editor version expects)
	•	Pinning fields (e.g., “Headline 1 pinned”, “Headline 2 pinned”, …)
	•	Asset-based extensions (Sitelinks/Callouts/Structured Snippets are Assets + Associations now, not legacy extensions)
	4.	Add a unit test that loads your generated CSV(s), reorders nothing, and byte-compares against a checked-in golden sample (allowing for dynamic values like campaign names via placeholders).

Scope tweak to your plan
	•	Add writers for:
	•	Campaigns (daily budget, networks=Search only, language=English, geo per market, device bid adj=mobile −100% if you want hard desktop)
	•	Ad Groups (CPC default if you ever switch from smart bidding, final URLs)
	•	Keywords (separate exact/phrase is fine)
	•	Responsive Search Ads (with pinning and 12–15 headlines / 3–4 descriptions; one headline pinned to contain “Chrome Extension”)
	•	Assets (Sitelink, Callout, Structured Snippet) and Asset Associations (associate at campaign level to reuse across groups; lighter CSVs and cleaner management)
	•	Shared Negative Keyword List and “Campaign ↔ Shared Set” association
	•	Include Final URL suffix with UTMs + ValueTrack (so Plausible + Ads both get attribution):
		
		utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={campaignid}&utm_content={adgroupid}-{creative}&utm_term={keyword}&matchtype={matchtype}
		
## Task 5 — Ads Script generator (guardrails that matter)

Add these baked-in constraints at the top of the script:
	•	const MAX_DAILY_BUDGET_AUD = 10; refuse to create any campaign exceeding this unless a comment flag ALLOW_HIGH_BUDGET=true is set.
	•	All new campaigns paused.
	•	Desktop-only device targeting by default.
	•	Locations: AU/US/GB via geo constants; fail if unknown market.
	•	Labels: apply a label like LBA_SEO_ADS_EXPERT_<yyyy-mm-dd> to every created entity so you can roll back or audit quickly.
	•	Dry-run switch: when DRY_RUN=true, print a JSON diff without mutating.

## Task 3 — URL health (broaden the gates)

Your current list is good; add:
	•	robots.txt disallow (use a small parser; if blocked, flag hard-fail).
	•	Redirect chain (follow up to 5 hops; if >1 hop or mix of protocols, warn).
	•	Canonical sanity (if canonical != final URL and points off-site or to a different language/market, warn).
	•	Soft-404 heuristic (HTTP 200 but <title> contains “404/Not Found”, or page has < N words).
	•	Hreflang presence for multi-market pages; warn if AU/US/GB pages all point to the same canonical without hreflang.
	•	Meta refresh detection (treat as fail).
	•	Optional Lighthouse-lite (don’t block on it): if TTFB > 1.5s or LCP image missing width/height, note as a quality warning (not a fail).

## Task 1/2 — Deterministic output & snapshots
	•	Freeze CSV order per spec: build a tiny “column registry” for each CSV type; writers assemble rows exactly in that order.
	•	Line endings: \r\n for CSV; ensure UTF-8 without BOM (Editor can be picky).
	•	Float precision: 2 decimals everywhere; Number.toFixed(2) at write time.
	•	Snapshot tests on bytes (read file as Buffer and compare), not on parsed objects only.

## Claims validator (Task 7)

Move from product-level booleans to use-case assertions:

claims_validation:
  webp_to_png:
    local_processing: true
    privacy_first: true
  heic_to_jpg:
    local_processing: false   # uploads used for this path
    privacy_first: false
    
Writers must redact or rewrite copy per cluster if a claim is false/unknown.

Localization (Task 8)
	•	Ensure SERP connector uses gl/hl and your Final URL per market (e.g., /au/…, /us/…) if you localize pages.
	•	Add localized title/meta variants in seo_pages.md; even subtle spelling (“colour” vs “color”) matters for PaletteKit in GB.

Diffing (Task 6)
	•	Include semantic diffs (e.g., RSA changed because 3 headlines added; list added/removals).
	•	Track SERP drift per cluster (blockers appeared/disappeared) to inform bid/content moves later.

CLI polish (Task 9)
	•	--format ads-editor is great. Add --export utm-template to emit the canonical UTM suffix for copy-paste into Ads settings.
	•	--validate-only to run schema + URL health + claims without making plan artifacts (fast precheck).

## Two blind spots
	1.	Sitelinks/Callouts/Structured snippets as assets
You’re only planning sitelinks; add writers for Callouts (e.g., “Free tier”, “Privacy-first”, “No login”) and Structured Snippets (Header: Features; Values: “WebP→PNG, HEIC→JPG, PDF↔JPG”). Low effort, noticeable CTR lift.
	2.	Shared negatives vs per-campaign
Create one Shared Negative List per product and associate it to all relevant campaigns. It scales better than copy-pasting negatives into each campaign.

⸻

## Performance realism

With URL health (HTTP + parse) and 20–30 SERP calls, <30s may be optimistic on cold cache. Set your hard budget to ≤2 minutes cold / ≤60s warm and output timings in summary.json so you know where time goes.

⸻

##  acceptance tests to run before you call v1.1 “done”
	•	Ads Editor round-trip: Import your CSVs into a sandbox account, then re-export from Editor and diff structure (expect value changes, not schema/column changes).
	•	Script dry-run: Loads in Ads Scripts without syntax errors; prints a sane diff; refuses when a URL health fail is present.
	•	Claims killer: Set local_processing=false for one cluster and verify the tool removes “no uploads” claims in RSA + briefs.
	•	Determinism: Two consecutive runs with identical inputs produce byte-identical CSVs/JSON/MD.
