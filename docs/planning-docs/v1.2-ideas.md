# v1.2 — First-party signals & continuous intelligence (3–5 days)

Goal: Tighten recommendations with your real data, catch regressions, and pre-seed better negatives.

## Upgrades
	1.	Search Terms & Paid & Organic joins (manual ingest)
	•	Accept inputs/google_ads/search_terms_<product>_<date>.csv (periodic export).
	•	Produce waste_report.md: high-cost no-convert n-grams, propose negatives per ad group.
	•	If Paid & Organic export is available, compute “protect winners” and “harvest opportunities” tables (SEO↔PPC gaps).
	2.	SERP monitoring & drift
	•	serp_watch.json: for top N clusters/markets, store last SERP features + top 10 domains. Flag changes (e.g., AI Overview appears, shopping pack added) with recommended bid/content moves.
	3.	Opportunity matrix & content calendar
	•	opportunity_matrix.csv: clusters × markets with impact score = (volume × intent × (1–blockers) × data_source_weight).
	•	Auto-generate a content calendar section in seo_pages.md (publish order + internal links).
	4.	Internal linking suggestions
	•	From product pages, propose cross-links (e.g., “ConvertMyFile → PaletteKit” where topical and policy-safe). Emit anchor text suggestions.
	5.	Performance budgets & timing
	•	Enforce plan runtime budgets (e.g., ≤2m cold, ≤1m warm). Log cache hit rate, per-connector timings, and any quota throttling.

## Nice-to-haves you can slot anywhere
	•	Bing Keyword Research connector (Edge users are real for extensions).
	•	Ads variations generator: automatically create 2 RSA variants per ad group (benefit-led vs proof-led) and label them in exports.
	•	Sitemap & robots checks: warn if new briefs lack a link path from the homepage or sitemap.
	•	UTM builder: emit canonical UTM templates for each ad group (keeps Plausible reports clean).
	•	Lighthouse content sanity: quick LCP/CLS metrics for proposed pages; fail if egregious.

## Engineering notes (to save you time)
	•	Data contracts: Lock JSON/CSV schemas now and add snapshot tests (vitest) for ads.json, seo_pages.md, and CSV headers—zero surprises when you iterate.
	•	Concurrency: cap SERP calls at 5–8 concurrent; enforce ≤30 total per run to keep RapidAPI cost predictable.
	•	Determinism: sort arrays before writing files; pin floats to 2–3 decimals so diffs are meaningful.
	•	Secrets: keep RapidAPI keys and (later) Ads OAuth tokens in .env; never write them into plans/ outputs.
