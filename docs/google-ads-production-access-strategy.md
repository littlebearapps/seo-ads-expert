## 3. Application Form Content

### 3.1 Company Information
```
Company Name: Little Bear Apps
Website: https://littlebearapps.com
Contact Email: nathan@littlebearapps.com
Business Type: Software Development / Digital Marketing Tools
```

### 3.2 Use Case Description (COPY THIS EXACTLY)
```
Use Case Title: Internal Campaign Management and Optimization Tool

Description:
We've developed an internal tool that helps our team manage and optimize our own Google Ads campaigns more efficiently. The tool retrieves performance data to generate optimization recommendations and automates routine reporting tasks for our marketing team.

The tool helps us:
- Monitor campaign performance across our product portfolio (ConvertMyFile, PaletteKit, NoteBridge)
- Generate weekly optimization reports for stakeholder meetings
- Identify underperforming keywords and ad groups
- Track budget utilization and pacing
- Export data for internal business intelligence dashboards

This is strictly for managing our own advertising accounts (Customer ID: 9495806872) and improving our internal workflows. We are not providing this as a service to external clients or reselling Google Ads management.

The tool complements the Google Ads interface by providing custom reports and analysis specific to our business needs, while all actual campaign changes are reviewed and applied manually through the Google Ads UI.
```

### 3.3 Technical Implementation
```
Implementation Type: Server-side application (Node.js CLI tool)
Authentication Method: OAuth 2.0 with user consent
Data Storage: Local SQLite database for caching (7-day retention)
API Usage: Read-only operations for reporting and analysis
Estimated Daily Operations: 500-1000 (well within Basic Access limits)
```

## 4. Access Level Selection

### Recommended: Basic Access
**Rationale**:
- 15,000 operations/day is 15-30x our actual needs
- Faster approval process
- Easier compliance requirements
- Can upgrade to Standard later if needed

**DO NOT** request Standard Access unless absolutely necessary.

## 7. Key Messaging Points

### 7.1 EMPHASIZE These Points
✅ **Internal use only** - Managing our own campaigns
✅ **Complementary tool** - Enhances, doesn't replace Google Ads UI
✅ **Reporting focus** - Analysis and insights, not automation
✅ **Manual review** - All optimizations reviewed by humans
✅ **Legitimate business** - Established company with real products
✅ **Conservative usage** - Well below API limits

### 7.2 AVOID These Red Flags

❌ **Automation** - Don't emphasize automated bid management
❌ **Reselling** - No mention of providing services to others
❌ **Competitor comparison** - Don't mention other platforms
❌ **Bypassing UI** - Don't suggest replacing Google Ads interface
❌ **Bulk operations** - Avoid mentioning large-scale changes

## 8. Common Objections and Responses

### "Why not use Google Ads UI?"
"The Google Ads UI is excellent for campaign management. Our tool complements it by providing custom reports and analysis specific to our product portfolio, helping us prepare for strategic meetings and track KPIs unique to our business model."

### "What about Google Ads Scripts?"
"Scripts are great for simple automation, but our tool needs to integrate with our existing business intelligence stack, generate reports in our specific format, and work with our other marketing data sources."

### "How many accounts will you access?"
"Only our own account (Customer ID: 9495806872). This is strictly for internal use."

## 9. Post-Approval Steps

1. **Test Connection**: Verify production access immediately
2. **Update Documentation**: Document the approved token
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track API operations to stay within limits
4. **Compliance Check**: Regular audits of API usage
5. **Backup Plan**: Maintain test account access as fallback

## 10. Contingency Planning

### If Rejected
1. **Review Feedback**: Carefully analyze rejection reasons
2. **Address Concerns**: Update application to address specific issues
3. **Enhance Documentation**: Improve privacy policy/terms if needed
4. **Reapply**: Wait 30 days before resubmission
5. **Alternative**: Consider Google Ads Scripts for basic needs

### If Additional Documentation Requested
Have ready:
- Business registration documents
