# Google Ads API Production Access Strategy (v2.0)

**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Updated**: 2025-10-08 (GPT-5 Strategic Review)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Version**: 2.0 - Human-in-the-Loop Optimization Platform

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for obtaining Google Ads API production access for Little Bear Apps' **SEO & Ads Expert v2.0**.

**KEY STRATEGIC SHIFT (v2.0):**
- ‚ùå **OLD**: "Internal tool for reporting only" (too limiting, hides capabilities)
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: "AI-assisted optimization platform with human-in-the-loop controls"

The v2.0 strategy **embraces** the tool's write operations, ML capabilities, and automation features while **emphasizing** robust safety rails, human oversight, and transparent auditability.

**GPT-5 Insight:** Google approves tools with automation IF they demonstrate:
1. Clear human-in-the-loop workflows (preview ‚Üí approve)
2. Transparent safeguards (caps, rollback, kill switch)
3. Comprehensive auditability (who/what/when logs)
4. User control (explicit opt-in, easy disable)

## 3. Application Form Content (v2.0)

### 3.1 Company Information
```
Company Name: Little Bear Apps
Website: https://littlebearapps.com
Contact Email: nathan@littlebearapps.com
Business Type: Software Development / SaaS Tools
```

### 3.2 Use Case Description ‚≠ê COPY THIS

**Title:** AI-Assisted Google Ads Optimization Platform

**Description:**
```
SEO Ads Expert is an intelligent optimization tool that helps advertisers improve
campaign performance through machine learning-driven recommendations. The tool
analyzes performance data using Thompson Sampling algorithms and surfaces
opportunities for budget reallocation, bid adjustments, keyword additions, and
creative improvements.

KEY FEATURES:
- Thompson Sampling (Bayesian optimization) prioritizes experiments
- Performance analysis identifies waste and opportunities
- Diff-based preview shows all proposed changes before application
- Human-in-the-loop workflow requires explicit user approval
- Optional auto-apply with strict guardrails (daily caps, rollback, kill switch)
- Comprehensive audit logs track all changes with before/after values

USE CASE:
We're building this tool to test optimization strategies across varied scenarios,
requiring both test account access (for algorithm development) and live account
access (for real-world validation). The tool initially serves our own campaigns
(Customer ID: 9495806872) with plans to offer to other advertisers as SaaS.

SAFETY & COMPLIANCE:
All changes occur only after user review and approval, or via explicitly enabled
auto-apply features with transparent logging, daily caps, and immediate rollback.
Users maintain full control via per-feature toggles and a kill switch.

The tool complements the Google Ads interface by providing ML-driven insights and
streamlined change workflows, while maintaining the same review-and-approve model.
```

### 3.3 Technical Implementation
```
Platform: Node.js CLI tool (future web UI planned)
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with user consent
Data Storage: SQLite with 7-day cache retention
Operations: Read (performance data) + Write (approved optimizations)
Estimated Daily Operations: 1,000-2,000 ops/day
Compliance: GDPR/CCPA data deletion, audit logging, encryption
```

---

## 4. Access Level Strategy

### Recommended: Basic Access (15,000 ops/day)

**Why Basic (not Test):**
- ‚úÖ Need live data for real-world algorithm validation
- ‚úÖ 15K ops/day accommodates testing across multiple accounts
- ‚úÖ Test Access too limited for Thompson Sampling experiments
- ‚úÖ Approval timeline similar (~2-5 business days)
