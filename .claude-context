- Remote: `https://github.com/littlebearapps/seo-ads-expert.git`

## üéâ Project Stage - V2.0 INTELLIGENT BUDGET OPTIMIZER TESTS COMPLETE

**Current Phase**: ‚úÖ V2.0 TEST-READY ‚Üí üîÑ TEST REMEDIATION IN PROGRESS
**Test Status**: 920/1,005 passing (91.5%) | 46/63 test files passing
**Last Session**: 2025-10-01
**Session Goal**: Fix test hanging issue + Complete Phase 6 ‚úÖ

## üìä Test Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: All test information is centralized in `docs/TESTS.md`

**What's in TESTS.md**:
- Complete catalog of all 63 test files organized by category
- Current pass/fail status (920/1,005 passing as of 2025-10-01)
- Failure analysis linked to remediation phases
- Test execution instructions and infrastructure details

**Maintenance**:
- Update after each phase completion or when test status changes
- Run `npm test -- --run` to get current counts
- Keep pass/fail sections accurate for future sessions

**Why centralized**: Previously test details were scattered across multiple files. Now TESTS.md is the single source of truth, making it easier to maintain and reducing context file sizes.
